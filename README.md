This is my attempt at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). First attempt at using TypeScript so bear with me.
A lot of these are naive and inefficient solutions but by the time I finish them, I'm too tired to optimise. Obviously this
isn't the same standard that production code should be held to.

Note that I'm not intending on completing these challenges as soon as possible. The final state of this repo may not include all challenges due to a number of possible reasons, including the fact that I may have simply lost interest and/or forgotten about it entirely.

To run any of the solutions, simply specify the day number. For example, to run the day 1 (trebuchet) solution, run:

```sh
npm run day1
```
Note: You will need to `npm install` before running
