This is my attempt at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). First attempt at using TypeScript so bear with me.

To run any of the solutions, simply specify the day number. For example, to run the day 1 (trebuchet) solution, run:

```sh
npm run day1
```
Note: You will need to `npm install` before running
